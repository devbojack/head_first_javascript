# Getting Your Feet Wet

## Points to note
- JavaScript is used to add behavior to web pages.
- Browsers begin executing JavaScript code as soon as they encounter the code in the page.
- Add JavaScript to your page with the &lt;script&gt; element.
- You can put your JavaScript inline in the web page, or link to a separate file containing your JavaScript from your HTML.
- Use the src attribute in the &lt;script&gt; tag to link to a separate JavaScript file.
- HTML declares the structure and content of your page; JavaScript computes values and adds behavior to your page.
- JavaScript programs are made up of a series of statements.
- One of the most common JavaScript statements is a variable declaration, which uses the var keyword to declare a new variable and the assignment operator, =, to assign a value to it.
- JavaScript expressions compute values.
- Three common types of expressions are numeric, string and boolean expressions.
- if/else statements allow you to make decisions in your code.
- while/for statements allow you to execute code many times by looping.
- Use console.log instead of alert to display messages to the Console.
- Console messages should be used primarily for troubleshooting as users will most likely never see console messages.
- JavaScript is most commonly found adding behavior to web pages, but is also used to script applications like Adobe Photoshop, OpenOffice and Google Apps, and is even used as a server-side programming language.
